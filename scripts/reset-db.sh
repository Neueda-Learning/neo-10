# Put your LOCAL database back to empty, so you can work from a clean board. Two
# settings, deliberately:
#
#   ./scripts/reset-db.sh            empty the tables   (seconds, keeps the schema)
#   ./scripts/reset-db.sh --hard     destroy the volume (docker compose down -v)
#   ./scripts/reset-db.sh --counts   just show me the row counts
#
# This empties THIS MODULE's tables. The sidecar's own log is separate — clear that from
# its page, or with: curl -X DELETE localhost:9000/api/v1/dispatches
#
# Which one you want:
#
#   You re-sent an application and want a clean row      → the default
#   Liquibase will not start: checksum mismatch, or a
#   changeset that failed halfway                        → --hard
#   Schema-validation: missing table/column               → NEITHER. Your entity and
#     your changelog disagree; write a changeset. A reset only hides it until the
#     next startup. (README, "If you break your database".)
#
# This touches nothing but this module's own schema on your laptop. The deployed
# environments have their own path — the "Database repair" workflow in the Actions
# tab, which is the only route to them, since you hold no AWS credentials.
